## Face Detector

This project is made using React framework. I have made this with react because it is easy to make ,easy to understand and it is easy to deploy as it can be deployed with Azure , Netlify , AWS Amlify etc. 
When you will build your environment will have everything for example:- 
1. React, JSX support which is required for the project.
2. Autoprefixed CSS which is very helpful as we do not have to use webkit.
3.  A live development server that warns about common mistakes.



The following commands will help you to build the project.

 
`` npm start
``
  

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

  

`` npm test
``
  

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  

``npm run build
``

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed!

  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

  
`` npm run eject
``

  

**Important Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
